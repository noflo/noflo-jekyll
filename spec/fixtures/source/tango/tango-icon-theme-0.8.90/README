Tango Icon Theme
----------------

This is an icon theme that follows the Tango visual guidelines [1]. Currently
it depends on Imagemagick for creation of 24x24 bitmaps by adding a 1px padding
around the 22x22px version. For GNOME and KDE you will also need
icon-naming-utils that allow the theme to work in these environments before
they follow the new naming scheme [2].
